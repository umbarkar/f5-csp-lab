Module 1: ELK Stack Build Ubuntu Server
=======================================

ELK stack from the previous module is made up of three key components:
	- Logstash, 
	- Elasticsearch,
	- Kibana.

There are many ready made ELK stack services that can be used:
	- Docker https://elk-docker.readthedocs.io/
	- AWS https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/
	- Azure https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/bitnami.elk?tab=Overview
	- Elastic Cloud https://www.elastic.co/cloud

However, it is important to understand how the ELK stack is build, the configuration files and their purposes.

This module will guide you through the installation of ELK stack onto a ubuntu server.
